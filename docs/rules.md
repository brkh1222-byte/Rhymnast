# Rules we automate

Source: FIG **Rhythmic Gymnastics Code of Points 2025-2028**, mark-up version valid from 1 April 2025
(link in `data/README.md`). "p. N" = page N of that PDF. The code values live in `web/js/rules.js`.

Status: ✅ = checked against the CoP text · ⚠️ = needs a human to verify.

**How D values were read:** in the difficulty tables the value columns are 0.10 … 0.70, and each
element code ends in its column number (e.g. `1.101` sits in the 0.10 column, `1.303` in 0.30).
So the value = last two digits × 0.10. Cross-checked against the worked examples in the text.

## Final score
- Final score = D score + A score + E score; penalties are deducted from the final (General #5.2, p. 12) ✅
- D: body difficulties (DB), **highest 8 counted** (Difficulty #1.5, p. 21) ✅
- A (Artistry) is judged by humans in our app.
- E max 10, built from execution faults. "Execution faults must be penalized every time and for each
  element at fault" (Execution #1.6) ✅, so repeats still get E deductions.
- Repetition of a difficulty from the same box is not valid (#8.9 jumps; #12.3 rotations: different
  rotations = different boxes regardless of number of turns) ✅

## General shape rule (jumps, balances, rotations)
Difficulty #2.5.1-2.5.4, p. 25. Deviation per incorrect body segment:

| Deviation from the required shape | DB | Execution penalty | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0° (exact shape or better) | valid | none | ✅ |
| small: ≤ 10° | valid | 0.10 per segment | ✅ |
| medium: 11-20° | valid | 0.30 per segment | ✅ |
| large: > 20° | **not valid** | 0.50 per segment | ✅ |

p. 26: "The angles are just a guideline. Judges will learn to think in terms of small, medium, and
large deductions." So the app shows **measured angle + suggested band**; a judge can reject it.

## Split leap: code 1.2103, value 0.30 ✅
- "A split position of 180° is required at the highest point of the leap. The split position may be
  horizontal and will also be accepted when the 180° position is maintained with 1 of the legs above
  and the other below a horizontal position." (table #9, p. 74) ✅
- Value: table #9 item 21, code 1.2103 → 0.30 (p. 78). Matches the example "DB valid: 0.30 p." on p. 72 ✅
- Basics: defined and fixed shape during flight; height sufficient to show it (#8.1.1, p. 72) ✅

**Measured as:** angle between the legs (mid-hip → each ankle), measured through the bottom so
over-splits read above 180°. Best value among frames near the top of the flight (hips ≥ 70% of max
rise). Deviation = 180 − angle → band above. Warns when a leg is foreshortened (camera not side-on).

## Passé balance: code 2.101, value 0.10 ✅
- Passé forward or side, thigh at horizontal (table #11 item 1, p. 88) ✅
- "Stop position fixed in the shape for a minimum of 1 second" (#10.1.2) ✅
- Held less than 1 s with a well-defined shape: valid, E penalty 0.30 "shape not held for a minimum
  1 second" (#10.2.2, p. 84) ✅. No stop at all (swing/kick): not valid (#10.2.3).
- On flat foot the value is reduced by 0.10 (#10.3, p. 84) ✅, so a flat-foot passé = 0.00.

**Measured as:** free thigh elevation from the knee's vertical position (works from any camera
direction); free foot at support-knee height; support leg straight; relevé = heel clearly above toes.
Shapes held under 0.3 s are treated as passing movements, not balance attempts.

## Passé pivot: code 3.101, value 0.10 for 360° ✅
- Minimum basic rotation 360° (#12.1.2, p. 91) ✅
- +0.10 per additional rotation for pivots with base value 0.10 (#12.2.5, p. 92) ✅
- Pivot "must be executed with a high relevé position"; low relevé = E penalty (#12.1.1) ⚠️ not automated
- Heel support stops further rotations from counting (#12.2.3) ⚠️ not automated

**Measured as:** rotations counted from the body's apparent width (wide when facing toward/away
from the camera, narrow when side-on; each change ≈ 90°). Accuracy about ±45°.

## Balances: shared rules ✅
- On the foot: "Defined and clearly fixed shape" and "Stop position fixed in the shape for a minimum
  of 1 second" (#10.1.2, p. 82) ✅
- Held < 1 s with a well-defined shape: valid, E −0.30 (#10.2.2, p. 84) ✅. No stop (swing/kick): not
  valid (#10.2.3) ✅ (we ignore holds under 0.3 s).
- Flat foot: value −0.10 (#10.3, p. 84) ✅. Support leg straight or bent: same value (#10.4) ✅.
- Deviations are per body segment and add up, e.g. "Small deviation of the split + Medium deviation of
  the trunk: 0.10 + 0.30 p., DB valid" and "Large deviation of the trunk 0.50 p., DB not valid"
  (examples, p. 83) ✅
- Holding the support leg with the hand: not valid (#10.5) ⚠️ not automated. Apparatus technical element
  required (#10.8) ⚠️ not automated (judges check).

## Front split balance with help: row 3, code 2.303, value 0.30 ⚠️ value
- Technique: "Front split with or without help · Split is required" (#10.11, p. 86) ✅
- Table #11 row 3 "Front split with or without help" lists 2.303 (0.30) and 2.305 (0.50) (p. 88).
  ⚠️ We assume **with help = 0.30, without help = 0.50** (order of the row title). Check the pictograms.
- **Measured as:** free leg forward of the head, straight; split = angle between the legs at the hips;
  deviation = 180° − split. "Help" = a wrist or finger within 0.3 torso lengths of the free shin/foot.
  Without help it's scored as 2.305; both are the same box, so only one counts.

## Back split balance without help (foot above head): row 10, code 2.1005, value 0.50 ⚠️ value
- Technique: "Free leg high up backward, without help · Split is NOT required; whole foot above the
  head is required · Touching is NOT required" (#10.11, p. 87) ✅
- Table #11 row 10 "Back split with help, also foot above head without help" lists 2.1003 (0.30) and
  2.1005 (0.50) (p. 89). ⚠️ We assume **foot above head without help = 0.50**. Check the pictograms.
- **Measured as:** free leg backward (foot behind the head), knee straight, leg at least 30° above
  horizontal, trunk lean < 60°. Deviation = degrees the leg must still rise at the hip until the lowest
  point of the foot (heel or toes) is above the top of the head. MediaPipe has no head-top point: we use
  the highest eye/ear/nose point + 0.2 torso lengths.
- Back split **with** help and trunk-forward back splits (row 11) are not scored: in 2D they look like a
  front split with the trunk bent back (seen on a competition photo).

## Attitude balance: row 12, code 2.1202, value 0.20 ⚠️ value
- Technique: "Attitude · Horizontal position of the free leg (thigh) and the maximum vertical position
  of the body" (#10.11, p. 87) ✅
- Table #11 row 12 "Attitude, also ring with help/with the leg on the shoulder, also ring without
  help/attitude with back bend of the trunk" lists 2.1202, 2.1203, 2.1204 (p. 89). ⚠️ We assume the plain
  attitude = 0.20 (first in the row title).
- **Measured as:** free leg backward, knee bent 60-140°, no hand on the leg, foot not at the head (that's
  a ring). Two segments: **thigh** deviation = 90° − thigh elevation; **trunk** deviation = lean from
  vertical. Each gets its own band and penalty (p. 83 examples).

## Not automated yet (judges enter by hand)
- Heavy landing; visibly arched back on landing; swing technique ("kip") (Execution table, p. 121) ⚠️
  penalty column to verify before automating
- Other balances (arabesque, side split, etc.): value columns on p. 88-89 are pictogram-dependent ⚠️
- Apparatus difficulties (DA), R elements, dance steps, apparatus faults, artistry
