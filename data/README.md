# Data

Nothing in this folder is committed (see `.gitignore`). This file explains where to get the data.

## Pose model
The MediaPipe Pose Landmarker model (`.task`) is loaded by the web app from Google's CDN at runtime.
You do not need to download it.

## Validation clips
We validate rules on **public competition videos** (FIG / national federation broadcasts on YouTube).
- Save clips locally in `data/clips/`, named `<element>_<source>_<n>.mp4`, e.g. `splitleap_fig2025_01.mp4`.
- Prefer clips filmed side-on to the gymnast (needed for reliable split angles).
- Track the source URL and timestamp of every clip in `data/clips/SOURCES.md` (also not committed).
- Do not redistribute the videos. Only keypoint JSON extracted from them goes into the repo as test fixtures.

## RG dataset (optional, reference only)
1000 rhythmic gymnastics routines (ball, clubs, hoop, ribbon) with D/E/total scores, from the
ACTION-NET repo: https://github.com/qinghuannn/ACTION-NET
- The repo has **no license**. Use it for internal reference only; do not redistribute.
- The OneDrive download link returned HTTP 403 to scripts on 2026-10-08. Try it in a browser.

## FIG Code of Points
RG Code of Points 2025-2028 (mark-up, valid from 1 April 2025), from the FIG rules page:
https://www.gymnastics.sport/publicdir/rules/files/en_1.1%20-%20RG%20Code%20of%20Points%202025-2028%20(mark-up)%20-%20valid%20from%201st%20April%202025.pdf
Rules we implement are summarized with page numbers in `docs/rules.md`.

## Validation photos (real people)
Used to **check and tune** the rules, not to train anything. Never commit them: they are photos of
real people, often minors. Keep them here locally and share them inside the team through a private
shared drive.

```
data/validation/
  front_split_help/   labels.csv + photos
  front_split/        (without help)
  back_split/         (without help, trunk upright, foot above head)
  attitude/
  not_these/          look-alikes and other shapes that must NOT be scored
```

`labels.csv` (optional, one per folder; the folder name is used when a photo has no row):

```
file,expected_shape,judge_deduction,notes
ana_01.jpg,attitude,0.10,thigh slightly low
ana_02.jpg,attitude,0,clean
```

- `expected_shape`: `front_split_help`, `front_split`, `back_split`, `attitude` or `none`
- `judge_deduction`: what a judge deducts **for the shape only** (deviation bands: 0, 0.10, 0.30, 0.50,
  or a sum such as 0.40 for thigh + trunk on an attitude). Leave empty if unknown.

How to take them:
- Camera **side-on** and level, at hip height; whole body in frame; both feet visible.
- Capture the held position, not the way in or out.
- For each element: some clean shapes **and** some with small, medium and large faults. The faults
  are what test the deductions. At least 10 photos per element, from several people.

Run them through <http://localhost:8000/tools/validate.html> (nothing is uploaded). It can export the
body-point numbers (no images) as `web/tests/fixtures/real-balances.js`, which turns every photo into
a permanent unit test.
